## Ruby on Rails Blog

Ruby on Rails, while not often mentioned today, still maintain a prevalence in the web development world.  In this repo, I am setting up a simple blog to play with RoR according to the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial on RailsGuide.

So far the hardest work was on installing ruby and Rails.  Even though MacOS comes with ruby installed, that version is quite out-of-date.  Initial attempts to use `rvm` to install any recent versions of ruby were futile.  However, I was finally able to install ruby with `asdf`.   

Below are the versions used for this blog:
* Ruby version
3.3.0
<!-- * System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ... -->
